# Dynamic Excel Sales Tracking for Maven Toys

This Excel project seems to be designed for Maven Toys to track sales performance. The cool part is that it's dynamic! Here's how the demo works:

1. Imagine the data sheet currently shows sales data from, say, January to August 2021.
2. You have September 2021 sales data in another location.
3. By copying and pasting September's data into a designated area below the existing data, the dashboard will automatically update.
4. You'll then see September's sales reflected in the charts and other visuals, allowing you to instantly track performance changes.

This eliminates the need to manually update formulas or recreate charts â€“ a real time-saver!
